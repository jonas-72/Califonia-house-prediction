California House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for predicting house prices in California. By utilizing a dataset containing various features related to housing properties, we can leverage the power of machine learning algorithms to estimate the prices of houses in this region.

The California House Price Prediction model utilizes supervised learning techniques to analyze and learn from historical housing data. The dataset comprises information such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, location, proximity to amenities, and other factors known to influence house prices. By training the model on this dataset, it can make predictions about the prices of new, unseen houses based on their features.

The main objective of this project is to provide accurate and reliable estimates of house prices to assist homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions. The machine learning model takes into account the relationships between various features and the corresponding house prices, allowing it to generalize and predict prices for new instances.
